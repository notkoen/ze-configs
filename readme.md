# Zombie Escape Configs

A collection of zombie escape configs that I've made or worked on. I open-source everything while avoiding configs made by others. However, I may accidentally push others' configs. If you want credit or files removed, please contact me via the options below.

## CS:GO

I am no longer maintaining CS:GO configs due to the release of CS2. All configs under the `csgo` folder should be considered final.

> [!CAUTION]
> All vscripts should be uploaded in the exact same folder structure.

> [!WARNING]
> All entwatch configs are made to work with **DarkerZ's Entwatch-DZ Plugin**, and all BossHP configs are made to work with **GFL's BossHP Plugin** or **AntiTeal's BossHUD Plugin**.

## CS:S

> [!TIP]
> More configs are available under Nide's [ZE-Configs](https://github.com/NiDE-gg/ZE-Configs) repository.

> [!WARNING]
> Entwatch configs differ between NiDE and Unloze.

> [!WARNING]
> All configs made **MUST BE** lowercase.

## CS2

Given the active development state of CS2, do not assume all configs are final. I will do my best to keep them updated.

> [!WARNING]
> All bosshp and entwatch configs are made to work with  **CS2Fixes**.
